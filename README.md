# lite-60

Hi D,
B found https://timeqube.com/ and asked if we could help make a stress-free timer for 60 minute counseling session

I have a microcontroller https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040/ configured and running code

using the complier Thonny https://thonny.org/

and editing the code in Notepad ++ with the language set to Python

The micronctoller will be housed in a 6 in night light https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VLSCFY8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1

## The revision Wishlist

rev.1

change the Python shell code from a "cycle timer" displaying different LED values (colors) for a set duration to an event-based timer

the 4 events are:
1. "majority of time remaining" (green LED value)
1. "half or less than half of time remaining" (yellow LED value)
1. "closing thoughts and topics for next session" (solid red LED value)
1. "session is over" (flashing red LED value)

## Usage

Fake version that doesn't actually try to use the LEDs:
```shell
python3 main_fake.py
```
